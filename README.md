# Starcraft II Terran Agent

A Stacraft II AI written in Python 3 using the [Dentosal sc2 library](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2)

This project contains two Zerg agents, one that rushes the enemy with zerglings and a more advanced one that builds some economy before launching a powerful attack. You can execute them in the src folder with:

```
python rush.py
python varg.py
```

For slowing down the game, set realTime to True in varg.py.
